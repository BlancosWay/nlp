\section{HMMs and CRFs}

A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) can be used a generative model of a system of linear symbols, like language.

\begin{tabular}
  Corpus & Training accuracy & Testing accuracy & OOV-only test accuracy & Time \\
  \midrule
  Atis & \\
  WSJ & \\



cross:
  corpus:     wsj / atis
  model:      crf / hmm
  oov:        all / only oov
  train/test: train / both
  features:   with ortho / normal / only ortho

measurements:
  run time
  variables




Report

Your report should contain a problem statement, the approach that you took to solve the problem, a brief discussion of the experiments you ran, including a nicely formatted table(s) of results, with training and test accuracy (both overall and just for OOV items), number of OOV items as a percentage of total test tokens, and run time for each approach for each corpus. Also include a discussion of your results that answers at least the following questions, where possible, explaining the results in terms of underlying algorithmic properties.
1. How does the overall test accuracy of CRF and HMM differ (when using only tokens) and why?
2. How does the test accuracy for OOV items for CRF and HMM differ (when using only tokens) and why?
3. How does the training accuracy of HMM and CRF differ and why?
4. How does the run time of HMM and CRF differ and why?
5. How does adding orthographic features affect the accuracy (both overall and OOV) and runtime of the CRF and why?
Which features helped the most? (i.e. try only including some feature types and not others)
If you are ambitious and have time, you might try adding additional types of features of your own design and discuss your results.
