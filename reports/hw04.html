Choose a scientific paper from a conference or journal related to your
proposed final project.  Read the chosen paper and write a short 2 page
type-written report.  The first page of the report should briefly summarize the
paper.  The second page should discuss limitations of this existing work
that your final project will address and/or how your own project relates to this
existing work by extending or replicating it in some way.  Each student on a
team project should report on a <i>different</i> related paper(s) and turn in their
own report. <i><b>A PDF copy of the report and the chosen paper(s) must be 
submitted as an attachment on the assignment submission page on Blackboard
